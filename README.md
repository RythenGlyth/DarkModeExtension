# Dark Mode Extension
This is a simple extension that allows you to toggle dark mode on any website. It uses the `invert` CSS filter to invert the colors of the website.

This is a simple way to get dark mode on any website, but it may not work perfectly on all websites.

The extension allows you to toggle dark mode on and off by clicking the extension icon in the browser toolbar or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Q`. You can also set the extension to automatically enable dark mode on websites which seem to have a light color scheme. Moreover, you can invert the colors of single elements using the context menu to fix issues with websites that don't work well with the extension.

## Installation

Download the extension and unzip the folder. Open the Extensions page in your browser (chrome://extensions) and enable Developer mode. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder or simply drag and drop the folder into the Extensions page.
